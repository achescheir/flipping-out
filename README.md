# flipping-out
This Jupyter notebook explores the effect of sample size on statistics using
coin flipping as an example case.Several helper functions are defined then used
to generate simulated coin flip data and analyze it with an eye toward sample
size effects.

## Use
This is a typical Jupyter notebook and so Jupyter and Python will be needed to
use it. A full list of requirements is in the requirements.txt file and can be
installed using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the requirements are fulfilled the notebook can be opened from Jupyter launched with:

    jupyter notebook

When Jupyter opens,  __coin-flips.ipynb__ can be run from within the program.

It is important that the blocks are executed in order. Many of the later blocks rely on data or functions defined in the earlier blocks.

It is unlikely but possible owing to the random nature of random variables that some of the charts may not resemble the charts that were commented upon. You may want to rerun the notebook in that case.
